# Room Occupancy Analysis And Prediction

With proliferation of IOT devices with various kinds of environment sensors, we currently are in a stage where the sensors data can be used to predict the state of room or building based on environmental conditions.

Using UCI Room Occupancy dataset. I tried to see if I can build a model to accurately predict the occupancy of the room based on environment sensors.

Please read room_occupancy.md for process of data analysis

Thank you.
